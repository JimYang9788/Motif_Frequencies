Motif analysis.
For the underlying sampling logic, please refer to the Kronecker's algorithm 
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KroneckersAlgorithm.html

The motif sampling algorithm focuses on finding the similarities between two 
graphs, and the complete algorithm design is described in the following link:
